Just a side summer project.  I have no idea what I'm doing.

Game information:

Genre/Type: Fantasy, Turn-based.

Description:
	There will be a world map with nodes which the player travels between.  Each of these nodes represents a location that can be an open field or city/settlement.  Each node has a combat map for the number of nodes connected to it.  Maps will consist of tiles that contain at least two properties: height, and terrain.

	Players will have an entourage of characters or actors in their party.  They should be able to change the actor's equipment, skill-sets, and their 'job' or 'class' outside of a combat map.

	In combat, actors move based off their accrued action points which is generated by their speeds.  Actors can only move a set number of tiles based off their movement attribute.
