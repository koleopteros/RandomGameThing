Maps:
	Represented by a two dimensional matrix.
	Each element in the matrix will contain a MapNode.

MapNode:
	contains information regarding current node.
	Mandatory Information:
		Height: 0 for bottom, 5 for sea level, 20 for maximum height
		Terrain: Contains terrain data which will apply a modifier to the actor within it.
	Optional Information: 
		State 1: Ground modifier (oil seeps into the ground, pitfall trap, etc.)
		State 2: Surface modifier (flames, snow, ice, water, etc)
		State 3: Air Modifier (smoke, fog, gas)

Terms:
	in/out: references incoming and outgoing.
	end of life: when a state lasts 3 turns and has reached the end of the third turn.

	Minor: between 1% to 3% effect.
	Moderate: between 3% to 5% effect.
	Major: 5% to 10% effect.
	Immense: 15% effect.
	Crazy amounts: 25% effect

Terrain:
	Grassland:
		- basic land
	Paved/Tiled:
		- reduces movement cost by 0.3
		- 'Burning' state cannot exist without 'Oil/Tar' state.
	Stone/Granite:
		- Lightning based area of effects are reduced to a single tile.
		- 'Burning' state cannot exist without 'Oil/Tar' state
		- minor bonus to Wind/Force based actions
	Sand/Desert:
		- increase movement cost by 0.5
		- if 'Oil/Tar' state was present before 'Burning', 'Oil/Tar' state duration increases to 4 turns; 'Burning' state begins at intensity 3.
	Forested:
		- Has an equivalent of 'Oil/Tar' state when 'Burning' state occurs.
		- increases mobile actors movement cost by 1
		- provides minor bonus to evasion of all infantry actors.


MapNode States:
(merely examples.  Could be worked on later)
/*Special case for 'Smoke'*/
	Smoke: 
		- lasts 8 turns (default)
		- reduce all resource regeneration, in/out accuracy by a immense amount.
		- reduces potency of fire-based actions
		- removes 'Burning' state.
	Oil/Tar:
		- lasts indefinitely, unless modified.
		- increase Movement cost by 1
		- When 'Burning' state when fire is applied, 'Oil/Tar' will persist for 2 turns.
	Burning (intensity):
		- intensity begins at 4(low), decreases to 0(high).
		- lasts Oil/Tar duration + intensity turns.
		- intensity < 4, reduces in/out accuracy and resource regeneration at an increasing rate.
		- inflicts 'Burning' state to any unit on the tile.
		- inflicts 'Burning' state to nearby 'Forested' terrain and 'Oil/Tar' states.
		- If 'Burning' state lasts the default length, converts to 'Smoke' state upon end of life.
	Fog:
		- increase potency of cold and lightning actions.
		- spreads a minor effect of cold and lightning actions to 1 tile distance.
		- reduces in/out accuracy.
		- reduces potency of fire-based actions.
		- remove 'Burning' state.
	Wet:
		- increase Movement cost by 1.
		- increase potency of cold and lightning actions.
		- spreads a minor effect of cold and lightning action to 1 tile distance.
		- reduces potency of in/out fire-based actions.
		- remove 'Burning' state.
